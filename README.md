# Agarwood-dataset-
This is my first Project which i used to gathered data of agarwood which we usually call wood of gods and its the most expensive wood in the world and when i tried to get dataset of this agarwood , i cant able to find even one dataset in Kaggle , So i decide to make one data and further ill modify changes by adding extra gathered details .  



# 🌳 Agarwood Tree Data Analysis (Mini Project)

This is a beginner-friendly data project where I created a sample dataset of different Agarwood tree species and performed basic data exploration using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## 📊 What's inside?
- Created a sample dataset with details like species, soil type, growth years, returns, etc.
- Exported the data as CSV using `pandas`.
- Visualized various aspects like:
  - Growth time vs return
  - Tree height comparison
  - Cost analysis per species

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
